Recoloring Shader Rework TODO
Code
	MFT variant name not updated properly -- is being updated to model name
	Flag Decal not working properly on MFTs -- is the shader being set to an improper shader, or the flag-updating code simply not called?
Adapter Textures
	First pass done.  Textures exist.  Need seam cleanup on diff/spec for painted textures.  Need diff/spec/nrm cleanup for gold/orange textures.
Adapter Configs
	Need to rename default texture set along with finding good names for the various mask-based sets
Tank Models

	Finish stripes3 texture
	Update 'NONE' mask to include detail area on detail channel
Tank Configs
Mount Models
	Need to re-UV many of them in order to allow for all stripe patterns.  May or may not be doable depending on the mount, if it was unwrapped in 1/2 or 1/4, etc.
Mount Textures
	Need masks for all
	Need re-export for all using separate AO bake

DOS Textures
