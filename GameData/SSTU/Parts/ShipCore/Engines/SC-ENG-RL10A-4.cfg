description = When the engineers at SSTU were trying to find a way to improve on the RL10A-3 thrust output, one of the recently acquired interns was heard saying 'why don't we just make it longer?'  Not to be outdone by the new guy, the senior engineers 'borrowed' that concept and started working on a new longer engine bell design.  Sadly, the quickly realized that this new engine would not fit any of the old designs because it was now too tall.  When that same intern was heard commenting about how to make shorter fuel tanks ('why don't we just cut them off?'), the lead-engineer of the engine redesign promptly 'borrowed' that idea as well; seemed like a good way to make things shorter.  They soon realized the new 'shorter-longer' engine was the same as the original short engine, and the lead-engineer came up with a brilliant idea to add the cut-off nozzle back onto the engine using a movable elevator system.
