// Resource boiloff data
// Each entry specifies:
//   * A resource that boiloff should be applied to (name)
//   * A percent per hour for resource loss if uninsulated (value)
//   * A cost per-liter of boiloff prevented (cost)
// These values may be further modified by settings in EITHER the SSTUResourceBoiloff module -OR-
// if a VolumeContainer is used on the part the values will be derived from the containers current
// ContainerModifier type for the container with the largest volume of the specific resource
//
// Currently only Liquid Hydrogen is defined, others may be added in the future at different rates
//
// To disable boiloff entirely, remove or disable this file
// To disable boiloff for a specific resource, remove its entry from this file
// To disable boiloff for a specific part, remove the SSTUResourceBoiloff module from its config
