These config files setup the default shader and texture assignments for models.

This is done through custom plugin code as the shaders being used are not supported by PartTools.

When used with the SSTU_TEXTURESET system, subsequent texture sets do not need to define re-used shader name or properties as long as the shader/property is consistent across -all- texture sets.
